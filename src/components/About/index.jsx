            My name is Nikki Goodridge. I was born and semi-raised in Florida. I spent a lot of my childhood summers in Salisbury, Massachusetts with my New England family. I went to high school in Longwood, Florida and eventually made my way to Tallahassee to enroll at FSU. While at FSU I managed to get a degree in History with a minor in the French language.

            After I graduated from FSU in the Fall of 2011 I went into teaching. I managed to get a job as long-term sub for both a history course and a French course at my old high school in Longwood. Eventually I would use teaching to help me travel the world and go to places like China, Indonesia, the Philippines and other places. I was able to teach my favorite subject at International schools and get a wide range of studnets under my belt. Eventually, I made my way back to the States in the summer of 2019, right before the Pandemic. During the Pandemic I realized that I wanted to do more with my life and decided to learn some coding skills. This led me to enroll in a Full-Stack Developer course at UCF. The course ran through Decemeber 2020 to May 2021. Afterwards I will be spending time honing some of my new skills and finding a possible job that will allow me to use my new skills in the tech market.
